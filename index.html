        <h1>Kevin's Beginner Website</h1>
        <p1>Welcome to my test web page. Click
            <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank" title="Let's go to YouTube">here</a>

            Apparently, you can <b>Bold text</b> by using the bold element (b) and <i>Italic text</i> by using the italic element (i). Now to use both at the same time.<br>
        <b><i>Bold, italic text.</i></b><br>
    This feels like I am editing my text like I would in my bio on the osu! website. I would put in italic<br>
and bold text like that, insert images, links, and other stuff like that. I suppose I did learn something from playing osu! for three years.</p1>
